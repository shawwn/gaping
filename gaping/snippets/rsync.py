This is a pure Python implementation of the [rsync algorithm](TM96).

### Example Use Case: ###

    # On the system containing the file that needs to be patched
    >>> unpatched = open("unpatched.file", "rb")
    >>> hashes = blockchecksums(unpatched)

    # On the remote system after having received `hashes`
    >>> patchedfile = open("patched.file", "rb")
    >>> delta = rsyncdelta(patchedfile, hashes)

    # System with the unpatched file after receiving `delta`
    >>> unpatched.seek(0)
    >>> save_to = open("locally-patched.file", "wb")
    >>> patchstream(unpatched, save_to, delta)
